# Student Portal Backend

A **Django REST Framework** based backend for a Student Portal system that manages users, staff, students, courses, and subjects. This project provides APIs to perform CRUD operations on all entities, supports authentication with JWT tokens, and uses a custom user model.

This project is being improved **incrementally** toward production-ready quality

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rauhan-sheikh/student_portal.git
cd student_portal
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser for admin access:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Incremental Progress

This project is under active development, with improvements added step by step:

âœ… Iteration 1: CRUD APIs with JWT auth

âœ… Iteration 2: Interactive API documentation (Swagger & ReDoc)

ðŸ”„ Next: User registration flow, role-based permissions, and testing

---

## Future Scope / Potential Additions

1. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Limit access for students, staff, and HODs to specific endpoints.
2. **Attendance Management**

   - Track student attendance with daily logs.

3. **Exams & Results**

   - Add models for exams, grades, and results.
   - APIs for teachers to upload results and students to view them.

4. **Notifications**

   - Email or in-app notifications for events like result declaration or announcements.

5. **Frontend Integration**

   - React.js or Angular frontend for a complete student portal.

6. **Profile Pictures**

   - Allow uploading profile pictures for students and staff.

7. **Search & Filters**

   - Search students by course, name, or email.
   - Filter subjects by course.

8. **Audit Logs**

   - Keep track of changes made by users (admin/staff).

9. **Deployment**

   - Prepare for deployment using **Docker**, **NGINX**, and **PostgreSQL**.

10. **Analytics**
    - Track student performance trends, attendance stats, etc.

This backend provides a **strong foundation** for a fully functional student portal and can be extended with more **academic features**, **role-based access**, and **analytics dashboards** in the future.
