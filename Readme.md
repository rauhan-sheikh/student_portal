# Student Portal Backend

A **Django REST Framework** based backend for a Student Portal system that manages users, staff, students, courses, and subjects. This project provides APIs to perform CRUD operations on all entities, supports authentication with JWT tokens, and uses a custom user model.

This project is being improved **incrementally** toward production-ready quality

## Features

- Custom user model with roles (HOD, Staff, Student)
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based permissions for endpoints
- CRUD APIs for users, staff, students, courses, and subjects
- Profile API: users can view their own profile (restricted by role)
- Change Password API: secure password update with old password validation
- Admin interface for model management
- Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI & ReDoc)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rauhan-sheikh/student_portal.git
cd student_portal
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser for admin access:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Incremental Progress

This project is under active development, with improvements added step by step:

âœ… Iteration 1: CRUD APIs with JWT auth

âœ… Iteration 2: Interactive API documentation (Swagger & ReDoc)

âœ… Iteration 3: Role-based permissions for HOD, Staff, and Students

âœ… Iteration 4: Profile & Change Password APIs

ðŸ”„ Next: Automated tests, error handling & logging

## Future Scope / Potential Additions

- Attendance Management â€“ Daily attendance logs for students

- Exams & Results â€“ Models & APIs for grades and results

- Notifications â€“ Email or in-app notifications

- Frontend Integration â€“ React.js
